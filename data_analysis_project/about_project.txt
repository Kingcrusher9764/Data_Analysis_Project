Project Title: Nashville Housing Data Cleaning using SQL

Description:

In the Nashville Housing Data Cleaning project, I undertook the crucial task of refining and preparing a dataset related to housing in Nashville using SQL. The dataset named "nashville_housing," presented a diverse array of information, including property details, sales transactions, and various attributes related to the housing market in Nashville.

The primary objective of the project was to ensure the dataset's accuracy, consistency, and completeness, laying the groundwork for subsequent data analysis and modeling efforts. Leveraging my expertise in SQL, I applied a systematic approach to identify and address issues within the dataset, employing a combination of SQL queries and data manipulation techniques.

Key tasks performed during the data cleaning process included:

1. Handling Missing Data: I meticulously addressed missing values by either imputing them with appropriate values or removing the rows where necessary. This step was crucial to prevent inaccuracies in subsequent analyses.

2. Ensuring Data Consistency: I conducted thorough checks for data consistency by standardizing formats, addressing typos, and resolving discrepancies in categorical variables. This step aimed to create a uniform and reliable dataset for analysis.

3. Identifying and Removing Duplicates: Duplicate records were identified and removed to eliminate redundancy in the dataset, ensuring that each entry was unique. This step streamlined the dataset and contributed to the overall data quality.

4. Data Type Standardization: I verified and standardized data types across different columns to ensure coherence and facilitate seamless analysis. This step involved converting data types where necessary and aligning them with the intended use of each variable.

5. Quality Assurance: Rigorous testing and validation were conducted at each stage to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the dataset. This process involved running SQL queries to spot anomalies and outliers that might impact the overall quality of the data.

6. Documentation and Reporting: To enhance the project's transparency and reproducibility, I maintained comprehensive documentation of the data cleaning process. This documentation included details on the steps taken, decisions made, and any notable observations, providing a clear trail for future reference.

By successfully completing the Nashville Housing Data Cleaning project, I not only improved the overall quality of the dataset but also set the stage for subsequent data analysis, allowing stakeholders to derive meaningful insights and make informed decisions based on reliable and well-organized housing data.
